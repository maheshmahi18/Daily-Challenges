Even/Odd Strength


The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must print the output based on the conditions given below.

- If the even integers have occurred more number of times than the odd integers then the program must print even as the output.

- If the odd integers have occurred more number of times than the even integers then the program must print odd as the output.

- If the even integers and the odd integers have occurred equal number of times then the program 
must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):

1 < = N <= 100

1 <= Each Integer Value <= 100

Input Format:

The first line contains the value of N.
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).

Output Format:

The first line contains odd or even or -1.

Example Input/Output I:

Input:

10
1 6 5 3 5 7 8 5 2 3

Output:

odd

Explanation:

The odd integers are 1, 5, 3, 5, 7, 5, 3 and the count is 7
The even integers are 6, 8, 2 and the count is 3
Here the odd integers count is maximum

Hence the output is odd

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Output:

-1


Sollution: Done in Python

n=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
b=0;c=0
for i in a:
    if(i%2==0):
        b+=1
    else:
        c+=1
if(b>c):
    print("even")
elif(b<c):
    print("odd")
elif(b==c):
    print(-1)


Sollution: In Java

import java.util.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    int n=sc.nextInt();
    int[] a=new int [n];
    int b=0,c=0;
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
    {
      a[i]=sc.nextInt();
      if(a[i]%2==0)
        b+=1;
      else
        c+=1;
    }
    if(b>c){
      System.out.print("even");
    }else if(b<c){
      System.out.print("odd");
    }else if(b==c){
      System.out.print(-1);
    }
  }
}
