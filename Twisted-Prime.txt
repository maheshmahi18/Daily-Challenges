Twisted Prime

The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print YES if N is a twisted prime number. Else the program must print NO as the output. A number is said to be twisted prime if it is a prime number and reverse of the number is also a prime number.

Boundary Condition(s):

1 <= N <= 10^16

Input Format:

The first line contains the value of N.

Output Format:

The first line contains either YES or NO.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

97

Output:

YES

Explanation:

97 is a prime number.

The reverse of 97 is 79. So 79 is also a prime number.

Hence the output is YES

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

34

Output:

NO


Sollution: Done in Python

def isPrime(n):
    if n<=1:
        return False

    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n%i==0:
            return False

    return True


n=input().strip()
r=n[::-1]
if(isPrime(int(n)) and isPrime(int(r))):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
