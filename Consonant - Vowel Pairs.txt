Consonant - Vowel Pairs


The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print all the pairs having a consonant followed by a vowel in the string S (in the order of occurrence) as the output.

Note: The string S always contains at least one pair having a consonant followed by a vowel.

Boundary Condition(s):

2 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:

The first line contains the string S.

Output Format:

The first line contains all the pairs having a consonant followed by a vowel separated by a space.


Example Input/Output I:

Input:

volcano

Output:

vo ca no


Explanation:
The string 'voLcano' contain three pairs having a consonant followed by a vowel.
So the pairs vo ca and no are printed as the output.


Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

TELEVISION

Output:

TE LE VI Sl



Sollution: Done in Python


s=input().strip()
a="aeiouAEIOU"
for i in range(len(s)-1):
  if((s[i] not in a) and s[i+1] in a):
    print(s[i]+s[i+1],end=" ")
