Multiples in Range


The program must accept five integers A, B, X, Y and Z as the input. The program must print the multiples of X, Y and Z in the range from A to B (inclusive of A and B) as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):

1 <= A <= X, Y, Z <= B <= 10^5

Input Format:

The first line contains the values of A and B separated by space(s).
The second line contains the values of X, Y and Z separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains the multiples of X, Y and Z in the range from A to B (inclusive of A and B) separated by a space.


Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

2 15
3 4 6

Output:

346891215


Example Input/Output 2:

Input:

20 50
24 30 41

Output:

24 30 41 48


Sollution: Done in Python


a,b=map(int,input().split())
x,y,z=map(int,input().split())
c=[x,y,z]
d=[]
for i in c:
    for j in range(a,b+1):
        if(j%i==0):
            d.append(j)
e=[*set(d)]
e.sort()
print(*e)
