Common Factors - Descending Order


The program must accept two positive integers X and Y as the input. The program must print the common factors of X and Y in the descending order.


Boundary Condition(s):

1 <= X, Y <= 10^8


Input Format:

The first line contains X and Y separated by a space.


Output Format:

The first line contains the common factors of X and Y in the reverse order.


Example Input/Output 1:


Input:

15 20


Output:

5 1


Explanation:

The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5 and 15.

The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20.

Here the common factors of 15 and 20 are 1 and 5. So they are printed in descending order.


Example Input/Output 2:


Input:

20 10


Output:

10 5 2 1




Sollution: Done in Python


a,b=map(int,input().split())
c=[]
for i in range(1,min(a,b)+1):
    if(a%i==0 and b%i==0):
        c.append(i)
c.sort(reverse=True)
print(*c)
