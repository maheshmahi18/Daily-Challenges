Longest Palindrome Length


The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the length of the longest palindrome that can be formed with the consonants in the string $ as the output.


Note:

At least one consonant must be present in the string S.

The string 5 contains only lower case alphabets


Boundary Condition(s);

1 <= Length of 5 <= 10^4


Input Format:

The first line contains the string S.


Output Format:

The first line contains the length of the longest palindrome in the string $.


Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
abcdeedb

Output:
5

Explanation:

The longest palindrome can be formed with bbddc (The order can be any but the length is 5).

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
racecar

Output:
4



Sollution: Done in Python


#Your code below
s = input().strip()
special = ""
v = "aeiou"
con_c = {}
max_len = 0
for c in s:
    if c not in v:
        special+=c
for c in special:
    con_c[c] = con_c.get(c,0) + 1
for c in con_c:
    max_len += con_c[c]//2*2
    con_c[c]%=2
if max_len<len(special):
    max_len+=1
print(max_len)
